# Project Overtview 
Ruth Asawa San Francisco's School of the Arts (SOTA) campus has an eroding hill that sends a lot of dirt into the 30 ft long drain at the base of the hill. During the rainy season the eroding hill causes the drainage system to clog and the area around the drain to flood. SOTA would like to have 30ft long retaining wall built to stop the hill from eroding into the drainage system and solve the flooding problem. To help SOTA solve this problem I created a service project will include i) clearing the drainage system, ii) constructing a retaining wall (18'' high x 33 feet long) and iii) adding  landscaping plants for additional erosion control and beatifying the hill (and adjacent patio).
